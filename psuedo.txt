Explain in depth  how psuedo elements are different from psuedo class selector with example?

A PSUEDO-CLASSis basically a phantom state or specific characteristic of an element
that can be targeted with CSS.They are  selectors with colon preceding them.
such as 
       a:hover
       
 we can use the new version of double colmuns for psuedo selectors such as
  ::before ::after but it is not compatible  for    old version.

        example  
                :link
                :visited 
                :hover
                :active 
                :first-child 
                etc..


A PSUEDO ELEMENTS are  like virtual elements they are not in html
but we can access them in css.
        example of PSUEDO ELEMENT code
                   in html
                        <h1>Girma</h1>
                   in css (this is psuedo element code)     
                         h1:before {
                         content: "Hello ";  
                         }

        as you have seen the html there is no word that say hello but if we link
        and run this code it say hello girma that's why we said psudeo elements are  
        like virtual elements.
    
            - ::AFTER/:AFTER
             - ::FIRST-LETTER/:FIRST-LETTER
             etc..
